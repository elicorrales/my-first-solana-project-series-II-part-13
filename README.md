# my-first-solana-project-series-II-part-13

### This project is part of a series and includes a video.

See [Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/blockchain-tutorials/blob/main/README.md) for the overall document that
refers to all the series.  
  

## In this video we learn how to  
- pass in command-line arguments to a Javascript client
- convert an ascii string to bytes so as to pass them to the Solana "TransactionInstruction" and thus "sendTransaction" and thus be received by the deployed on-chain Rust program
